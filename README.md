Electrical resistivity tomography is an efficient geophysical technique to investigate the spatial extent of subsurface structures. Many scientific objectives in geology demand three-dimensional imaging. 

3D electrical resistivity tomography provides a technique to survey three-dimensional structures. Nonetheless, 3D electrical resistivity tomography requires an enormous amount of time as well as a high work load. 

In most cases, 2D electrical resistivity tomography is used to obtain two-dimensional subsurface profiles. This package enables to visualize two-dimensional profiles in three dimensions.
 
## Requirements
- installation of R: http://www.r-project.org/
- the following packages from CRAN:
  - rgl
  - lattice
  - fields
  
## Example Usage
### Profile
An object of the Profile class is created for each profile:
```
p1 <- new("Profile",
            title = "Profile 1",
            xyzData = 
              new("XyzData", 
                  address = "example/xyzFiles/p1_DipolDipol_SW-NE.xyz"),
            rawData = 
              new("RawData",
                  address = "example/rawdata/p1_DipolDipol_SW-NE.dat"),
            measurementType = "DipolDipol",
            gpsCoordinates = 
              new("GpsCoordinates",
                  address = "example/gps/p1.txt"))
```

### Profile Set
An instance of the ProfileSet class is created using a list of single profiles.
```
sinkhole <- new("ProfileSet",
                profiles = list(p1, p2, p3),
                title="Sinkhole")
```

### Adjust Profile Height
GPS measurement heights might differ. Therefore, the height of a single profile can be adjusted.
```
p3 <- heightAdjustment(p3, -10)
```

### Plotting Methods
- ```plotRaw()```
- ```plotRawHeight()```
- ```plotXyz()```
- ```plotXyzHeight()```
- ```levelplotRaw()```
- ```levelplotXyz()```
- ```levelplotXyzHeight()```
- ```levelplotLegendLabel()```
- ```plotLegend()```
- ```plotIntersect()```
- ```plot3dXyz()```

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- the following packages from CRAN:
  - tcltk
  - tkrplot
- do one of the following steps:
  - execute start_gui.sh
  - open R in console and type ```source("gui.r")```
  - open an R GUI like RStudio and source gui.r
